# Fullscreen Sectioned Layout - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the redesign of the Texas Senate Bill Tracker frontend to implement a fullscreen sectioned layout with sticky scrolling behavior. The design will create distinct, full-viewport sections that users can navigate through with smooth, locked scrolling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fullscreen Hero Section

**User Story:** As a user visiting the site, I want the hero image to occupy the entire first viewport so that I get a full, immersive introduction to AWARE TEXAS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the hero section SHALL occupy 100% of the viewport height (100vh)
2. WHEN the hero section is displayed THEN the AWARE TEXAS image SHALL be centered and fully visible within the viewport
3. WHEN viewing the hero section THEN no other content SHALL be visible without scrolling
4. WHEN the hero section is active THEN it SHALL have no overlap with other sections

### Requirement 2: Fullscreen Search Section

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search section to occupy its own full page when I scroll down so that I can focus entirely on searching for bills without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll down from the hero section THEN the search section SHALL occupy 100% of the viewport height
2. WHEN the search section is displayed THEN all search controls and filters SHALL be properly contained within the viewport
3. WHEN viewing the search section THEN the hero section SHALL not be visible
4. WHEN the search section is active THEN the bill results SHALL be contained within the remaining viewport space

### Requirement 3: Sticky Scroll Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth, locked scrolling between sections so that I can easily navigate between the hero and search areas with precise control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I scroll down THEN the page SHALL snap to the next full section
2. WHEN I scroll up THEN the page SHALL snap to the previous full section
3. WHEN scrolling between sections THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and controlled
4. WHEN a section is active THEN it SHALL be locked in place until the user scrolls to change sections
5. WHEN using scroll wheel or touch gestures THEN the snap behavior SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 4: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the fullscreen sectioned layout to work properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop so that I have a consistent experience across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN each section SHALL still occupy the full viewport height
2. WHEN viewing on tablets THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately while maintaining section integrity
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the fullscreen sections SHALL utilize the available space effectively
4. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN sections SHALL automatically adjust to maintain 100vh height

### Requirement 5: Content Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the content within each section to be properly organized and accessible so that I can easily interact with all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the hero section THEN the AWARE TEXAS branding SHALL be prominently displayed and centered
2. WHEN viewing the search section THEN all search controls SHALL be easily accessible within the viewport
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL fit within the search section's allocated space
4. WHEN content exceeds the section height THEN appropriate scrolling SHALL be available within that section only

### Requirement 6: Navigation Indicators

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual indicators of which section I'm currently viewing and how to navigate between sections so that I understand the page structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any section THEN there SHALL be a visual indicator showing the current section
2. WHEN multiple sections exist THEN navigation dots or indicators SHALL show the total number of sections
3. WHEN hovering over navigation indicators THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback
4. WHEN clicking navigation indicators THEN the page SHALL smoothly scroll to the selected section

## Technical Considerations

- Implementation should use CSS Scroll Snap API for smooth section transitions
- JavaScript may be needed for enhanced scroll behavior and navigation indicators
- Viewport height calculations should account for mobile browser UI elements
- Performance should be optimized for smooth scrolling animations
- Accessibility considerations for keyboard navigation between sections

## Success Criteria

- Hero section displays full AWARE TEXAS branding in complete viewport
- Search section provides focused, distraction-free bill searching experience
- Smooth, predictable scrolling behavior between sections
- Responsive design works across all device types
- No content overlap or visual artifacts during transitions
